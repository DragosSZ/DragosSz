# Hi there, I'm Dragos! 👋

### 🎓 Automation & Applied Informatics Student | 🛠️ Embedded Systems Engineer | 💻 Full-Stack Developer

I am a final-year student at the **Technical University of Cluj-Napoca**. My passion lies at the intersection of hardware and software—building systems that are not only robust in code but functional in the physical world.

With **2 years of professional experience** in the automotive industry and a strong background in leadership through **Rotaract**, I bring discipline, technical precision, and a collaborative spirit to every project.

## 🎓 Current Research & Bachelor's Thesis

### 🛡️ Evaluating CNNs in Malware Classification
**Title:** *Evaluating the Efficacy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Malware Classification Based on Binary File Visualization*

I am currently conducting deep learning research to bridge the gap between **Cybersecurity** and **Computer Vision**. My thesis proposes a novel approach to detecting malicious software by treating binary code as visual data.

* **The Concept:** Converting raw binary executables into grayscale images, where different code sections (headers, data segments) manifest as distinct visual textures.
* **The Solution:** Training **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify these "images" as malware or benign, effectively bypassing obfuscation techniques that fool traditional signature-based detection.
* **Tech Stack:**
    * **Languages:** Python (Core logic & Data processing)
    * **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch, Keras (CNN Architecture implementation)
    * **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, PIL (Binary-to-Image conversion)
    * **Data Science:** NumPy, Pandas (Dataset manipulation & preprocessing)
